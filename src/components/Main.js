        <p>Dogs have always fascinated me, I enjoy spending time with them, taking care of them 
            and I'm totally into their training and behavior. 
          I also love exploring the great outdoors, taking long walks with my furry friends by my side.
          <br/>Furtherome, I love cooking! I'm always experimenting in the kitchen, whipping up tasty dishes 
          that make my taste buds dance.
